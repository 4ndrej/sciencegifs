title:  "Induction Heating"

An alternating current passing through a copper coil induces a magnetic field around the coil per [Faraday's Law of Induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction). A piece of metal placed within that oscillating magnetic field will experience the opposite effect as an electric current is induced within the metal. These [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) passing through the metal induce an opposing magnetic field around the piece of metal and cause it to heat up through a process known as [Joule heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating). The stronger the change in magnetic field, the more heat generation.

When a piece of aluminum is placed within a magnetic field generated using a 1.6 kW power inverter operating at 204 kHz, it rapidly heats and eventually melts at 660 °C. The molten aluminum reaches a final temperature of 1,200 °C before the current is finally shut off.
