title:  "Dust and Cosmic Rays on Comet 67P"
---

Previously unreleased imagery from the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft reveal ice and dust on the surface of [Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko). The images were captured on June 1, 2016, over the course of 25 minutes at an altitude of roughly 13 km above the surface of the comet. Comet 67P is a Jupiter-family comet originally from the Kuiper belt and has an orbital period of 6.45 years.

The majority of the "snow" is actually caused by [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) hitting the camera sensor and saturating pixels. These high energy particles pervade the Universe and originate from extrasolar phenomena such as supernovae, galactic nuclei, quasars, and gamma-ray bursts. The Earth's atmosphere protects us from the deleterious effects of cosmic rays.
