title:  "Micromotor Fertilization"
---

Science fiction has long written of using microscopic robots to perform medical tasks within the human body. These tiny machines can readily access vasculature, tissue, and organs without the need for invasive surgery. While we're still a long way from autonomous robots swimming around in our bloodstream, scientists are making significant progress.

This helix-shaped micromotor is powered by an external magnetic field and demonstrates its cargo-carrying capacity by assisting with artificial fertilization. The micromotor envelopes an immotile bovine sperm and carries it to an egg cell. The spinning of the helix mimics the motion of flagella commonly used by many microorganisms for locomotion.
