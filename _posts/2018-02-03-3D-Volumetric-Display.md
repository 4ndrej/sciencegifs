Holograms have been a staple of science-fiction for decades yet they are commonly misrepresented in popular culture. According to physics, a [hologram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography) is a photographic recording of how light scatters from an object that can be displayed in a manner that appears three-dimensional. So when R2-D2 projects Princess Leia's message in the original Star Wars movie, it technically is not a hologram because it could be viewed from any orientation. What it is is a visual representation of an object in three physical dimensions known as a [volumetric display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_display).

Researchers at Brigham Young University have created a volumetric display system that uses photophoretic optical trapping to produce three-dimensional color graphics. [Photophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photophoresis) is a phenomenon that allows small particles in air to be captured and precisely moved using a laser. As the particle is rapidly scanned through the display volume, it is selectively illuminated using red, green, and blue lasers to create various colors. The result is a three-dimensional image in free space that can be viewed from any angle without the limitations of current holographic or light-field technologies.
