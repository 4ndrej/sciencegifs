# Colliding Vortex Rings

Hydrodynamics is the study of liquids in motion and a subdiscipline of fluid dynamics. It seeks to describe and explain interactions within and between liquids using the laws of physics. These interactions can be extremely complex and often lack empirical explanations.

In 1992, a short letter to Nature depicted the head-on collision of two vortex rings and an attempt to explain some of the dynamics. This experiment was recreated by Destin of [SmarterEveryDay](https://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2) and imaged using modern high-speed cameras in incredible detail. Per his request, I've excluded the highlight of the footage to encourage you to check out the original video on YouTube (see link below).
