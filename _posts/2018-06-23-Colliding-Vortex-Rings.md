title:  "Colliding Vortex Rings"
---

Hydrodynamics is the study of liquids in motion and a subdiscipline of fluid
dynamics. It seeks to describe and explain interactions within and between
liquids using the laws of physics. These interactions can be extremely complex
and often lack empirical explanations.  
  
In 1992, a short letter to _Nature_ depicted the head-on collision of two
vortex rings and an attempt to explain some of the dynamics. This experiment
was recreated by Destin of
+[SmarterEveryDay](https://plus.google.com/108289803974286068198) and imaged
using modern high-speed cameras in incredible detail. Per his request, I've
excluded the highlight of the footage to encourage you to check out the
original video on YouTube (see link below).
