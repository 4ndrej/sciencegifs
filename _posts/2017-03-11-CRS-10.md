title:  "CRS-10 Falcon 9 First Stage Landing"
---

A couple weeks ago, SpaceX successfully launched a cargo resupply mission from LC-39A to the International Space Station (ISS). As the Dragon CRS capsule continued onwards towards the ISS, the Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket performed a vertical landing at Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1) in Cape Canaveral. Launch Complex 39 was previously used by NASA for the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs and is now being leased by SpaceX for Falcon 9 launches.
