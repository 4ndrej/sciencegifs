title:  "Zygote Cleavage"
---

This incredible time-lapse microscopy by filmmaker Francis Chee shows the early development of a frog zygote (fertilized egg) over the course of 33 hours. The cells composing the zygote undergo cleavages, which are rapid cellular divisions that increase the number of cells (blastomeres) without increasing the mass. Cleavage ends with the formation of a hollow sphere of blastomeres known as the blastula.
