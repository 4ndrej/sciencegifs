title:  "Bean Germination"
---

Germination is the process by which a plant grows from a seed or similar structure. Initiation of germination is highly dependent upon internal and external conditions such as temperature, availability of water and oxygen, and sometimes light intensity. Many seeds remain dormant until the appropriate environmental conditions are attained in order to increase viability.

Here, a kidney bean can be seen growing over the course of 25 days in a soil cross-section. Beans are the seeds of legumes, which are flowering plants in the family _Fabaceae_. During the first week of growth, the subsurface root structure is established to increase the seedling's access to nutrients and to provide support for the emergence of the stem. As the aboveground portion develops, significant motion can be seen as the plant grows towards light and nutrients through a process known as [tropism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropism).
