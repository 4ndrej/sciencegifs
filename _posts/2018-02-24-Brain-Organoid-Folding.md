title:  "Brain Organoid Folding"
---

Gyrification is the developmental process that forms the characteristic folds of the cerebral cortex in the brain. It allows for increased cortical surface area and therefore greater cognitive functionality within a smaller space. Studying the wrinkling and folding of brain tissue during development is critical for providing a better understanding of the brain and various disorders.

Scientists have created human brain organoids on-a-chip to study the physics of brain wrinkling. These small compartments allow for in situ fluorescent imaging of stem cells as they develop over the course of weeks. As the organoid grows, convolutions begin to emerge in the cellular structure. The results reported in Nature Physics suggest that mechanical instabilities drive the wrinkling process as the outer regions of the organoid exhibit increased growth while the inner surface contracts.
