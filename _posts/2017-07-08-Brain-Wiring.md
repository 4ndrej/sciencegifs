Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized medicine and biomedical research since its inception in the early 1970's. The technique relies upon strong magnetic fields and radio waves to non-invasively generate three-dimensional anatomical imagery without requiring the use of ionizing radiation (e.g. x-rays).

This detailed scan of the brain generated by Cardiff University's Brain Research Imaging Centre uses a different MRI technique called Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which maps the flow of water inside the brain. DTI measures a parameter called anisotropy, which describes the directionality of water molecule diffusion within neuronal structures. By performing a voxel-by-voxel analysis, researchers can construct three-dimensional representations of the axonal tracts in the brain.
