title:  "First re-flight of orbital class rocket"
---

Last Thursday, SpaceX successfully re-launched and landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket on the drone ship _Of Course I Still Love You_. This is the first re-flight of an orbital class rocket in human history (sorry Blue Origin, you don't count) and a major milestone for the space industry. The ability to re-use the most expensive part of a rocket promises to drastically reduce the cost of future spaceflight.
