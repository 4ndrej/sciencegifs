title:  "3-D Printing Liquids"
---

Material scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have developed a technique to print three-dimensional structures made entirely of liquids. Using a modified 3-D printer, they inject streams of surfactant-sheathed water into silicone oil to form tubes of liquid within another liquid. The threads of water have been printed with diameters ranging between 10Âµm to 1mm with a variety of spiraling and branching structures. The researchers hope to use the technique to construct liquid electronics, perform molecular separation, or precisely deliver components to more complex structures.
