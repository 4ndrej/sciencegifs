title:  "Dissolving Dichloromethane"
---

There is growing interest in studying chemical systems capable of autonomous shape changes and self-motion. When a droplet of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) is placed in an aqueous surfactant solution, cohesive motion is spontaneously generated. The droplets can pulsate, form multi-armed rotors, and arrange into polygonal shapes. The motion is driven by a combination of evaporation, solubilization, and surfactant transfer that all lead to Marangoni instabilities along the fluid interface.
