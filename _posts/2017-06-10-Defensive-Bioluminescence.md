title:  "Defensive Bioluminescence"
---

Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism that is most widely found amongst marine animals and most famously in fireflies. The primary chemical reaction that occurs is the mixture of the light-emitting pigment luciferin and the enzyme luciferase. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin, which results in the release of blue-green light.

Ostracods, also known as seed shrimp, are small crustaceans found across a wide range of water environments. A subset of ostracods possess light organs used in bioluminescent predation defense. When attacked, the small plankton produce a blinding cloud of light that startles the predator, allowing the ostracod to escape. Here, cardinalfish can be seen eating and then expelling ostracods after they employ their bioluminescent defensive technique.
