title:  "SpaceX successfully launches the Falcon Heavy"
---

SpaceX successfully tested its new [Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy) launch system earlier today by propelling a dummy payload of founder Elon Musk's +Tesla Roadster into orbit around the Sun. The Falcon Heavy consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 rocket core with two Falcon first stages as strap-on boosters. All three rockets are reusable and designed to land vertically after separating from the delivery vehicle.

Here, the two Falcon 9 boosters can be seen landing simultaneously in Cape Canaveral, FL. The central core was supposed to land on a remote drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean but all signs indicate it was likely lost during re-entry. Despite this, the maiden flight of the Falcon Heavy was declared a resounding success and promises to usher in a new era of cheaper orbital delivery costs.
