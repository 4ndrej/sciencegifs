title:  "Sodium Borohydride + Tin Tetrachloride"
---

Sodium Borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>) is a broadly used reducing agent most commonly found as a white powder. Tin Tetrachloride (SnCl<sub>4</sub>) is a colorless hygroscopic liquid, which fumes on contact with air, and is predominantly used in organotin chemistry. It was also used as a chemical weapon during World War I to form irritating, dense smoke on the battlefield.

The exothermic reaction between aqueous NaBH<sub>4</sub> and SnCl<sub>4</sub> involves the borohydride reducing the Tin(IV) to Tin metal, forming BH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> gas in the process.
