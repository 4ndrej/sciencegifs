title:  "Cassini's Grand Finale"
---

After almost 13 years in orbit around Saturn, NASA's _Cassini_ spacecraft is preparing for the final chapter of its extraordinary mission. On Wednesday, April 26, the probe will begin the first in a series of twenty two dives between the planet and its ornate rings. _Cassini_ will be the first spacecraft to traverse the 1,500-mile gap and scientists hope to gleam further insights into the formation of giant gas planets.

Finally, on September 15, _Cassini_ will be sent plunging into Saturn's atmosphere where it will be destroyed by the intense heat of reentry. This method of disposal was selected to minimize the risk of biological contamination of Saturn's moons. Data pertaining to atmospheric composition will be transmitted until the very end.

_Cassini_ is responsible for an immense body of knowledge about our Solar System. From tests validating Einstein's theory of general relativity to discovering seven new moons orbiting Saturn to landing the Huygens probe on the surface of Titan, the spacecraft has been a workhorse of NASA, ESA, and ASI for well over a decade.
