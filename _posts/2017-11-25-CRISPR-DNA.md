title:  "Cleavage of DNA by CRISPR-Cas9"
---

Scientists have used atomic force microscopy to visualize the real-time dynamics of CRISPR-Cas9 as it binds and cleaves a strand of DNA. The high speed imaging technique captures the Cas9 enzyme as it searches for, binds to, and cuts a matching DNA sequence. CRISPR has received extensive media coverage over the past few years because of its ability to easily edit genetic material.
