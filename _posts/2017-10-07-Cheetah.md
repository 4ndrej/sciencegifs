title:  "Cheetah in Slow Motion"
---

Cheetahs are the fastest land animals on the planet, capable of reaching top speeds of 112 km/h (70 mph) during short bursts. They are famous for their high-speed pursuit of prey across the plains of Sub-Saharan Africa and are frequently featured in nature documentaries.

This female cheetah from the Cincinnati Zoo was recorded using a high-speed camera (1,200 fps) mounted on a sliding rig. She traversed a 100 meter distance in only 5.95 seconds, reaching a top speed of 98 km/h (61 mph). This GIF depicts a 0.4-second segment of that sprint and reveals the rapid leg motion and stability required to attain such high speeds. The cheetah uses its long tail to perform rudder-like steering in order to make sharp turns while chasing prey.

It is estimated that only 7,100 individuals remain in the wild, prompting calls for the cheetah to be classified as an endangered species. Habitat loss, poaching, and the illegal pet trade have all contributed to the significant decline over recent years.
