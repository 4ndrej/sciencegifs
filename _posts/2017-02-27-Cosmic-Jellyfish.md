title:  "'Cosmic' jellyfish from the Utu seamount"
---

The _Okeanos Explorer_ is an exploratory vessel operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dedicated to exploring the seabed and ocean crust. This deep-sea jellyfish was imaged during a robotic submersible dive last week in the unexplored Utu Seamount of the American Samoa. The jellyfish's reproductive organs can easily be seen in yellow and the circulatory system in red.
