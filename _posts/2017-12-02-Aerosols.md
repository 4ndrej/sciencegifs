title:  "Aerosols over North American"
---

Aerosols are small particles or liquid droplets in the air that can be tracked to better understand the dynamics of our atmosphere. This computer model was created by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office to visualize the movement of sea salt, dust, and smoke across North America and the northern Atlantic Ocean.

Smoke from the forest fires in the Pacific Northwest can be seen billowing across the continent while dust from the Sahara Desert is blown all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. Numerous hurricanes can be seen traversing the Atlantic Ocean and impacting the Caribbean Islands and the United States mainland.  

NASA used its _Goddard Earth Observing System_ mathematical models in conjunction with observation satellite data to produce this complex representation of the currents of the atmosphere. These models help provide a better understanding of our planet's weather and climate.
