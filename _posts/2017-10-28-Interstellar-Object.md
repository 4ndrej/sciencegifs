title:  "First Interstellar Object Observed By Astronomers"
---

Astronomers have observed what they believe to be the first interstellar object entering the solar system from elsewhere in our galaxy. The small asteroid or comet -- designated _A/2017 U1_ -- is an estimated 400m in diameter and moving remarkably fast at 25.5km/s.

It was first detected on October 19th by the _Pan-STARRS 1_ telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii, during a routine search for near-Earth objects. The extreme orbit of the object, nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, led researchers to conclude that it likely originated from beyond our solar system. On October 14th, _A/2017 U1_ passed within 24 million kilometers of Earth (~60x the distance to the Moon) on its way back to interstellar space.
