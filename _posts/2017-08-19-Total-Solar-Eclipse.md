title:  "Total Solar Eclipse"
---

On Monday, August 21st, the continental United States will experience its first total solar eclipse since 1979 as the Moon passes in front of the Sun. During the period of time when the Moon completely obscures the Sun (totality), the solar corona will become visible to the naked eye. This aura of plasma surrounds all stars and extends millions of kilometers into space. The corona is also much hotter than the visible surface of the Sun, with temperatures ranging between 1,000,000 - 3,000,000° Celsius.

This timelapse depicts a total solar eclipse that occurred in November 2012 as seen from Queensland, Australia. Ángel R. López-Sánchez at the Australian Astronomical Observatory captured this imagery using a refractor telescope with a solar filter blocking 99.9997% of the incident light.
