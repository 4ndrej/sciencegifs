title:  "Stars of the Galactic Center"
---

The galactic center is the rotational center of our Milky Way galaxy located approximately 25,000 light-years from the Earth. It is believed to contain a supermassive black hole designated Sagittarius A* that has a diameter of 44 million kilometers (0.3 AU), or roughly the distance between our Sun and the planet Mercury. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany have estimated the black hole has a mass 4.3 million times that of our Sun.

These animations depict stellar orbits around the galactic center between 1995 through 2013 as imaged by the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The dynamics of these orbits and a simple understanding of _Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion_ provide substantial evidence for the existence of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole. Paradoxically, observations of the galactic center have revealed that there are very few old stars and many more young stars than expected. 

In order to image the center of the galaxy using terrestrial telescopes, adaptive optics are employed to correct for the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere.
